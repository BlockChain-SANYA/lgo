# Trouble shootings

## old export format no longer supported

### Symptom
Got error messages like:

```
could not import github.com/yunabe/mylib (/home/yunabe/local/gocode/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/yunabe/mylib.a: import "github.com/yunabe/mylib": old export format no longer supported (recompile library))
```

### Reason and Solution
Some libraries installed in your `$GOPATH` are in the old format, which are built go1.6 or before.
Make sure all libraries under your `$GOPATH` are recompiled with your current go compiler.

```
cd $GOPATH/src; go install ./...
```
